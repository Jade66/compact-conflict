<h1>Compact Conflict</h1>

<p>The game lasts <b>12</b> turns. The <b>winner</b> is the player controlling <b>the most regions</b> at the end.</p>

<h2>Temples</h2>

<ul>
<li>Each player starts with one temple under their control.</li>
<li>There are also neutral temples that you can conquer.</li>
<li>At the end of your turn, each of your temples <b>produces a new soldier</b>.</li>
<li>Temples can be imbued with fire, earth, air or water to get special abilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Armies</h2>

<ul>
<li>You get <b>3 moves</b> per turn - each of them allows to move one army to a neighbouring region.</li>
<li>An <b>army that has conquered a region cannot move again</b> this turn.</li>
<li>If you move into an occupied region, a battle ensues, with both sides dealing damage.</li>
<li>If you manage to <b>kill all defenders</b>, you take over the region.</li>
<li>If the <b>defenders survive</b>, your army moves back and you can try invading again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Income</h2>

<ul>
<li>Once you end your turn, new faith is generated: <b>1 for each region</b> you control, and <b>1 for each soldier</b> praying at one of your temples.</li>
<li>You also get <b>4 faith</b> for each soldier killed in defense of a region.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrades</h2>

<ul>
<li>Upgrades are purchased with faith. They grant special abilities to temples.</li>
<li>There are <b>2 levels</b> of each upgrade.</li>
<li>If a temple is lost, the <b>upgrade is lost with it</b>.</li>
<li>Instead of an upgrade, you can use faith to <b>recruit soldiers</b>. The more soldiers you recruit, the more expensive it gets.</li>
</ul>
