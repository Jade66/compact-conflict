Compact Conflict
================

You can [play it right here](http://krajzeg.github.io/compact-conflict) on Github.

A minuscule risk-based strategy game for [JS13k 2014](http://js13kgames.com/).

#### The code

All the magic happens in `erisk.js` and `index.html`. 

If you want to build your own minified versions, `build.sh` can hook you up, but it needs the following installed:

* uglifyjs
* htmlminifier

Both are modules on **npm**.
